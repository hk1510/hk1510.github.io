 I'm a computing science MSc student at the University of Alberta working with [Marlos C. Machado](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~machado/). I'm primarily interested in Reinforcement Learning and am currently working on eigenoptions. 
 
 Previously, I interned as a Data Scientist at [Disney Television Animation](https://disneytvanimation.com/) and [City of Hope](https://www.cityofhope.org/). I also analyzed and identified crime trends for the [City of Los Angeles](https://medium.com/datala/a-data-driven-exploration-of-crime-trends-in-los-angeles-6124c2980eda).
